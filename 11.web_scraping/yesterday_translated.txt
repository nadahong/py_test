No matter how much I wait, I can't go.
By the side of your nose
Why don't you know who hurt me?
Wait, let's go.
I want to see you.
This is enough to convince me
I want to cry. On your knees.
If it couldn't happen,
I remember losing my mind
Memories are looking for you, but ...
Love is no longer true.
I can't lock you up.
You can't do this.
I'd like to see you as soon as I die.
I want to see you.
This is enough to convince me
Believe it or not, it's the right path.
I have to leave for you.
I remember losing my mind
Memories are looking for you, but ...
Love is no longer true.
I can't lock you up.
I remember losing my mind
Memories are looking for you, but ...
Love is no longer true.
I can't keep you in my excuses.
You can't do this.
I'd like to see you as soon as I die.
To death
I want to forget it.
